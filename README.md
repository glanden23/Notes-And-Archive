# Notes & Archive
A github I use to mess around with ideas, new languages and store old projects. All of this is under the MIT license. https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/

# Structure
Anything under the SICTC folder was made while I was in class. Everything else was learned on my own time.

# Closed Source Projects
Sadly a lot of my projects can't be open source due to them being made for someone else or including information I can't publish. You can check out my about me for info on my currently active projects. https://github.com/glanden23/AboutMe
