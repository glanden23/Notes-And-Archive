# Sandbox
A github I use to mess around with ideas and new languages. All of this is under the MIT license. https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/

# Structure
Anything under the SICTC folder was made while I was in class. Everything else was learned on my own time.

# Closed Source Projects
Sadly a lot of my projects can't be open source due to them being made for someone else or including information I can't publish. Anything that has been abandoned I will try to post here. You can check out my about me for some more info on these projects. https://github.com/glanden23/AboutMe
